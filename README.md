# 💻 A Website Portfolio About Me 👋 

✏️ Made using Next.js, Markdown, and TypeScript with help from the template: '[blog-starter](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter)'.

💭 This portfolio provides more in-depth details on my thoughts as well as more easy-to-see overviews of each of my projects and skills. It was created to expand my knowledge of Next.js and improve my web development skills. Through this project, I have gotten much better at React and Typescript!
