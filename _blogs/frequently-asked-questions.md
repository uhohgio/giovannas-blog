## Why a Portfolio?

I needed to build my brand slighly more than I have, and with my newfound excitement for web development, I decided a web portfolio was a great way to kill two birds with one stone. Of course, one can never have an original idea, but I have also learned many new ways I can show off my skills using this format and I plan to implement them soon!

## Why a Blog?

What is the point of implementing a new, scalable, dynamic part of my website dedicated to blog posts?

My portfolio is my form of self-expression. A way of refining my voice and skills, then showing them off to the world. This blog itself allows me to practice my writing skills and styling skills, while the process of making it allows me to practice my development skills, particularly automation and clarity.
