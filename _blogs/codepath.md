## What is CodePath?


CodePath is a U.S.-based organization aimed at preparing college students with the technical skills they need to succeed in the tech industry. They offer a variety of courses at no cost to current students and certifications to go with them, ensuring employers that these students were able to pass exams and prove their skills.



## Technical Interview Prep 102


TIP 102 is the shorthand for the Intermediate Technical Interview Prep course. 

    "The TIP pathway focuses on empowering students to ace technical interviewing
     and give them a preview of real-world challenges in the industry. With AI as 
     each student's companion, these courses are designed to prepare students to 
     become self-sufficient learners, meaningfully communicate technical concepts 
     and approaches, and solve challenging algorithmic problems commonly used in 
     interviews for top companies. The course also integrates a variety of resources 
     from the Career Center, including interview practice, industry mentors, and 
     advanced info sessions from senior engineers. Along the way, students learn 
     techniques for using AI as a debugging partner, always-available TA, and research 
     assistant, enabling them to focus on their core interviewing skills."

This course encourages us to leverage our resources to discover patterns and exercise our problem solving skills.


## My Experience


### How/Why I got into CodePath

I was introduced to CodePath by a friend, Martina, who like me was looking for more ways to boost her resume outside of college. She knew I was looking for free alternatives to Udemy where I could gain skills and have certificates of proof that I did. Having already graduated when I found CodePath, my options were limited, but I took what I could get and landed in the Advanced Technical Interview Prep Course (TIP 102). While Martina did not take this particular course with me due to schedule conflicts, I am very grateful to her for extending the opportunity to me in quick enough time for me to be able to apply and get accepted. 

I committed to the program to stay sharp and motivated. Especially at the start of my self-guided learning journey, it was a great way for me to get used to pushing myself to meet my own deadlines and to get comfortable working from home instead of having my school's library to help me study. Though a bit more rigorous than I had anticipated, CodePath's community was very encouraging and I would recommend it to anyone who has the opportunity. 

### What we did

The TIP Course consisted of two 2-hour-long class meetings a week with one hour of lecture and one hour of lab. At the end of each week, we took an assessment to evaluate our understanding of that week's material and this is what determines whether or not students pass with an advanced certificate or a normal one (there were advanced assessments and normal ones, where advanced assessments had more abstract questions and difficult data to evaluate the same skills in the same hour and a half time limit).

## Application

Since completing CodePath, I have felt much more confident in my ability to understand algorithms and to problem solve. 

In the world of software engineering and software development, knowing data structures through and through, knowing how to use and manipulate them to solve problems seen often in software development is an important skill. Deciphering which algorithm to use where may not be a necessity for everyday development, but the problem solving abilities that are strengthened by sharpening this skill are irreplaceable.
