## What is CodePath?


CodePath is a United-States based organization aimed at prepping college students with the technical skills they need to succeed in the tech industry. They offer a variety of courses at no cost to current students and certifications to go with them, ensuring employers that these students were able to pass exams and prove their skills.



## Technical Interview Prep 102


TIP 102 is the shorthand for the Intermediate Technical Interview Prep course. 

    "The TIP pathway focuses on empowering students to ace technical interviewing
     and give them a preview of real-world challenges in the industry. With AI as 
     each student's companion, these courses are designed to prepare students to 
     become self-sufficient learners, meaningfully communicate technical concepts 
     and approaches, and solve challenging algorithmic problems commonly used in 
     interviews for top companies. The course also integrates a variety of resources 
     from the Career Center, including interview practice, industry mentors, and 
     advanced info sessions from senior engineers. Along the way, students learn 
     techniques for using AI as a debugging partner, always-available TA, and research 
     assistant, enabling them to focus on their core interviewing skills."

By nature of this course, we were able to use our resources to discover patterns and exercise our problem solving skills.
