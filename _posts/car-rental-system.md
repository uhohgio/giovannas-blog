Our team was tasked to design a car rental system with full documentation given a short breakdown of necessary requirements.

The following Github repository shows our process as well our final documentation in standard format and powerpoint format.

## What I learned!

Throughout the creation of this project I learned about the ins and outs of project documentation and planning. I learned about life cycle models, requirements engineering, use cases, types of software architecture, class diagrams, verification and validation, data management systems, and more about collaborating on a software system. 

These topics were well cemented in my mind and I was able to use them 2 years later on my other team's Ice Track system!
