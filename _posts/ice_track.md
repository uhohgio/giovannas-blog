Our team was tasked to develop an automated tracking system for Tom and Adamâ€™s Ice Cream Company.  The automated system, referred to as ICE TRACK, will provide the initial tracking capability by 12/7/2024. The clients for this system have indicated that ICE TRACK should support the following business functional areas: 
Order Entry, Inventory Management, Shipment Tracking, and Trouble Ticket Management

Ice Track was originally created as an assignment for a software engineering course at SDSU.

I, along with 6 other students, created the skeleton of an online web application that allows you to to track and update the inventory for an ice cream company.

## What I learned!

Throughout the creation of this project I learned from the ground up how to make websites using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It took a lot of time and I will admit plenty of the process was rushed because of the time constraint, but I feel very confident that I understand how to read HTML, CSS, and Javascript because of it. It has also increased my curiosity and pushed me to learn Javascript to a slightly more fluent level. With this portfolio I am hoping to improve those skills much more. 

Ice Track also introduced me to the world of Flask and API development. Although I had help with a lot of the setup, I was solely responsible for connecting the website to all of the backend functions. This meant that I had to learn what all of the functions did and what their purpose would be as it pertained to the website and then go back and tweak the website to match functions made by my teammates. Luckily my teammates were very responsive, I was able to go to them and ask them for clarification on things as well as adjustments if I thought the website would respond better given certain implementations of functions.

After integrating the main functions made by my team, I took some of that learning to make smaller functions to fulfil minor requirements such as a login and signup feature to monitor access control and that was a fun, surface level way of also engaging in the backend. Although I was labeled as the "Front-End Developer" on this project I really did get to experience a bit of everything from manipulation of the database to the styling of every button on the app. 

I will also take much credit for spearheading the documentation on this project. I organized everything the way that it is and in a way that is navigable and clear. I, along with the project manager, helped keep our team on track with deadlines and clarity with documentation and I think we did a very good job. That being said, our project manager, Matthew Smith, did a fantastic job with helping our team with setup, debugging, and clarity in a very comprehensive way.
