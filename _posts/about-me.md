My name is Giovanna Ehrig, and I am a recent computer science graduate from San Diego State University.

<!-- about me but the long version -->
## Who am I?

As a product of my upbringing, computers have always been a big part of my life and I have always considered myself to be a creative. Contrary to popular belief, engineering is a very creative skill. I may not have an engineering degree, but I am fascinated by the world of technical creation and I am excited to pursue the world of software to see where that may lead me.
