Hi! I'm Giovanna Ehrig, a recent Computer Science graduate from San Diego State University. I'm 23 years old and actively involved in communities like Girls Who Code and Aztec Gaming, where I continue to support and engage with like-minded creators.

In my free time, I love working on small projects to expand my skills, whether it's game development, app development, or web design. I’m currently focusing on improving this very portfolio to sharpen my JSX and web development abilities. Beyond coding, I enjoy playing video games and working on hands-on creative projects with my dad—anything from building small structures to crocheting.

<!-- about me but the long version -->
## Who am I?

I've always had a deep connection to technology and creativity. Ever since I was young, I’ve been fascinated by both app and game development, leading me to explore a little bit of everything.

When working on mini-games, I try to make everything from scratch—from coding and UI design to creating my own art assets. While sound design is still a challenge, I love experimenting or collaborating with friends to bring my projects to life.

Right now, I’m embracing the freedom to explore and learn as much as I can. While I know I'll eventually specialize in one area, I’m enjoying the journey of discovery by building, creating, and continuously improving my craft.
