At Treobytes, I was challenged to teach video game development to middle schoolers. This was far from easy, but it was a lot of fun.

## Teaching

I learned a lot about what kids want, how they see the world, some of the ways that kids were raised now, especially in comparison to when I was younger. I have some experience with this at home because of my younger siblings, but it was interesting to see the difference between my siblings and students with different upbringings. I know that it is different because of the difference of roles that I play in these kids lives, but still it was quite eye-opening.

## Microstudio

"Microstudio is a free, 2D, open source game engine, code centric, integrated, available in the cloud or offline." 

With its very own language, Microscript, this game engine was really interesting and simple to learn, this made it a great tool for collaborating with students and forcing them to learn to code in a very user-friendly, instantly-gratifying way. Although limited in the scope of games that can be made, I loved the simplicity and ease of being able to incorporate whatever you wanted. I found that the simplicity of the engine makes the debugging and problem solving aspects of video game development very intuitive.
