## What is this?

Music by MIZU is a music portfolio, made by Giovanna Ehrig. While currently under development, it is a fully functioning website with links to MIZU's work and playing demos for fans! As a developer, I am currently working on making a content management system so that MIZU can update this page with new songs, update links, add albums, and overall update the database without needing to know how the code works.
